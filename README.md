# Traffic-Signs-Classifier
This project is an object detection project using YOLO V5 algorithm.
we use YOLO V5s and YOLO V5m to classify traffic signs. first you should prepare your dataset which in this case, the dataset is uploaded in Kaggle :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/golsaalavi/traffic-signs .
you can write the same code for YOLO V5l and YOLO v5x. using YOLO V5x increases the accuracy and so the time needed for the model to be trained.
